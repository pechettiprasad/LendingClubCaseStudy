## General Information
- Problem Statement
Business problems are solved using EDA In this case study, apart from applying the techniques in EDA,
also a basics of risk analytics in banking and financial services and data is used to minimize the risk of losing
money while lending to customers
Business Objectives
Thiscompany is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical
procedures Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to â€˜ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit
loss) Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the
money owed In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders In this case, the
customers labelled as 'charged off' are the '
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of
credit loss Identification of such applicant's using EDA is the aim of this case study
Inother words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i e the
variables which are strong indicators of default The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk
assessment
To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics
(understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough)
